                <p>My name's Max Yeamans, and I currently reside in Arizona (actually, I've always lived in Arizona). I first got into coding when I was in sixth grade; after finding out that one of my favorite video game fan sites was run by some guys not much older than myself, I decided to learn how to make web pages, too. I spent a couple years maintaining web sites on such esteemed services as Geocities and Angelfire.</p>
                <p>My interest in coding has waxed and waned since then. I got into drumming, which led to playing in high school marching band, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE3tSDK6uq8">drum corps</a> (I'm the guy in the sun on the far right), and the Phoenix Suns. In college, I got really into learning ancient Latin and Greek, and eventually graduated with a degree in Classical Studies. (The irony of having a degree in dead languages and also being interested in coding is not lost on me.)</p>
                <p>In addition to web development, I have a little bit of experience in object-oriented programming (Visual Basic, C#, Java) and SQL. JavaScript is what originally scared me away from learning to code so many years ago, so I'm hoping to make that one of my main focuses over the coming months.</p>
